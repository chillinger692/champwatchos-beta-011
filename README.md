* For 0.12, A mini calculator, calendar and conversions (from km to miles for walking distance, and common other conversions)
* Microbit V1 is unlikely to get 0.12 (If it does, it will be a cut down version due to lack of storage)
* Report Bugs please, so they can be fixed for 0.111

* V1 uses different branch now (20th Feb 09:23 GMT), as the 16KB ram is inadequate for even 0.1101.
